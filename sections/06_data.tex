\subsection{Data for modelling}

Data was extracted from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP), the national stroke registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for all patients with an out-of-hospital stroke onset for the full calendar years of 2016-2021. The registry contains  patients admitted to all acutely-admitting hospitals, with a case ascertainment of over 90\% when compared to administrative data (Hospital Episode Statistics). The total number of patients was 360,381, of whom 38.5\% arrived within 4 hours of known stroke onset. Of those arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset 90.4\% arrived by ambulance (71.6\% of those not arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset arrived by ambulance).

The following data fields from SSNAP were used in the modelling:

\begin{itemize}

% Coding 0-1 for Yes/No not needed here

    \item \textit{Stroke team}: Stroke team attended (hospital identifier).

    \item \textit{Age}: Age (as midpoint of 5 year age bands).

    \item \textit{Sex}: Sex of patient. % Keep as 'sex'; 'gender' more about psychological identity/alignment than physical/biological attributes

    \item \textit{Atrial fibrillation diagnosis}: Patient had a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, either on arrival or diagnosed during admission.

    \item \textit{Use of atrial fibrillation (AF) anticoagulants}: Use of prior anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation.

    \item \textit{Onset known}: Whether onset was known, and if known whether it was considered to be known precisely or was a best estimate.

    \item \textit{Onset during sleep}: Did stroke occur in sleep?

    \item \textit{Onset-to-arrival time}: Time from onset of stroke to arrival at hospital (minutes), when known.

    \item \textit{Prior disability level}: Estimated mRS score prior to stroke.

    \item \textit{Stroke type}: Infarction/haemorrhage.

    \item \textit{Stroke severity}: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on arrival.

    \item \textit{Arrival-to-scan time}: Time from arrival at hospital to scan (minutes), when known.

    \item \textit{Scan-to-thrombolysis time}: Time from arrival at hospital to scan to treatment with thrombolysis (minutes), when given.

    \item \textit{Disability on discharge}: mRS (0-6) on discharge, includes death (mRS 6) during admission.
    
\end{itemize}

Appendix section\ref{sec:stats} provides descriptive statistics for patients across stroke teams. See sections \ref{sec:paper_2} to \ref{sec:paper_5} for further details on data used for each component of the modelling work.



\subsubsection{Ethics}

For modelling, as we were using anonymised secondary data, collected for national audit, individual consent is not required. SSNAP has approval under section 251 of the NHS Health and Social Care Act (2006) to collect patient level data on the first six months of patient care (ECC 6- 02(FT3)/2012), without requiring individual patient consent. Access to SSNAP data is managed by the UK Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP), with this project being approved by HQIP (HQIP303). More information on the use of patient data by SSNAP can be found at \url{https://www.strokeaudit.org/ SupportFiles/Documents/Patient-area-documents/Fair-processingstatement-for-patients-v7-0.aspx}

As we are using anonymised secondary data, collected for national audit, used for service evaluation and improvement, no ethical approval is required (confirmed using the NHS Health Research Authority decision aid: https://www.hra-decisiontools.org.uk/ethics/).

\subsection{Data for qualitative research}

Qualitative research used a combination of ethnographic observations, interviews and documentary analysis. See section \ref{sec:paper_1} for further details.

\subsubsection{Ethics}

For the qualitative study, NHS Health Research Authority (HRA) \& Health and Care Research Wales (HCRW) approval was provided by the Essex Research Ethics Committee in August 2023 (IRAS 322303; REC reference 23/EE/0124).
