\subsection{Data for modelling}

Data extracted from the national stroke registry for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) for all patients with out-of-hospital stroke for the full calendar years of 2016-2021. The registry contains all consecutive patients admitted to 100\% of acutely-admitting hospitals with a case ascertainment of over 90\% when compared to administrative data (Hospital Episode Statistics). The total number of patients was 360,381, of whom 38.5\% arrived within 4 hours of known stroke onset. Of those arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset 90.4\% arrived by ambulance (71.6\% of those not arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset arrived by ambulance).

The following data fields from SSNAP were used in the modelling:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textit{Stroke team}: Stroke team attended (hospital identifier).

    \item \textit{Age}: As midpoint of 5 year age bands.

    \item \textit{Sex}: Sex of patient (male/female)

    \item \textit{Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation}: Did the patient have a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, either made prior to admission, or during admission?

    \item \textit{Use of anticoagulants}: Use of prior anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation.

    \item \textit{Onset known}: Whether onset was known, and if known whether it was considered to be known precisely or was a best estimate.

    \item \textit{Onset during sleep}: Did stroke occur in sleep? (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

    \item \textit{Onset-to-arrival time}: Time from onset of stroke to arrival at hospital (minutes), when known.

    \item \textit{Prior disability level}: Estimated modified Rankin Scale, mRS, prior to stroke.

    \item \textit{Stroke type}: Infarction/haemorrhage.

    \item \textit{Stroke severity}: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on arrival.

    \item \textit{Arrival-to-scan time}: Time from arrival at hospital to scan (minutes), when known.

    \item \textit{Scan-to-thrombolysis time}: Time from arrival at hospital to scan to treatment with thrombolysis  (minutes), when given.

    \item \textit{Disability on discharge}: mRS (0-6) on discharge, includes death (mRS 6) during admission.
