\subsection{Predicting willingness to use thrombolysis from SSNAP organisational audit data}

We performed a model to investigate whether organisational audit results reported by SSNAP could be used to predict a teams willingness to use thrombolysis (as measured by the SHAP value for the stroke team in the thrombolysis decision model). We were not able to predict willingness to use thrombolysis from these data (see \url{https://github.com/samuel-book/thrombolysis_organisational_factors/blob/main/data_prep/2c_statsmodels.ipynb}).
