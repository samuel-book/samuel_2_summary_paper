\section{Patient and Public Involvement}

Results have been regularly presented to a Patient and Carers Involvement (PCI) team. The PCI team has advised on both qualitative and quantitative research, and have helped shape communication of results.

In particular, the PCI have always advocated that it is outcomes, rather than any particular thrombolysis use target, that matters most. They also highlighted that modified Rankin Scale is an incomplete view of patient outcome, with particular omittance of a measure of patients' mental health or cognitive well-being. This has led to the development of a new funded project, working with the Stroke Data Science Catalyst (a partnership between the Stroke Association, the British Heart Foundation, and Health Data Research UK). This new project is looking at longer term outcomes from stroke, in the first instance focusing on days spent in care or at usual place of residence in the first 12 months after stroke.

The PCI team have also suggested, and will help with, further outputs from the SAMueL project. This will include short videos (e.g. for YouTube) and articles for relevant publications such as the Stroke Association's \textit{Stroke News} magazine.

\section{Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI)}

Although EDI was not a focus of this particular project's objectives, to build substantial EDI into future work, we have performed the ground work required to link analysis of stroke treatment and outcomes to population demographics for each stroke team. We have combined data from multiple sources (at Lower Super Output Area, LSOA) and collated according to stroke unit catchment areas (estimated by assigning each LSOA to the stroke team with the shortest travel time), and other areas such as Integrated Stroke Delivery Networks, and ambulance trust.

Data (source data and combined data) and code for this is available at: \url{https://github.com/samuel-book/stroke_unit_demographics}. Analysis is also made available by a web application at: \url{https://stroke-unit-demographics.streamlit.app/Interactive_demo}.

\section{Impact and Learning}

The following sections show how this work is already being used and adopted.

\subsection{Production and demonstration code, with artificial patient data}

Core analysis from this project is being implemented by SSNAP. This will give each team a bespoke thrombolysis target, based on their own local patient populations. For this, code, with artificial patient data, has been made available at \url{https://github.com/samuel-book/samuel_2_demo}. Artificial data made available is produced by sampling patient attributes separately from distributions based on real patient data attending each stroke team (with rounding/censoring process times and ages); covariances between sampled features are not maintained. This method may sometimes combine combinations of patient features that are not realistic of real patients. For machine learning data, the use of thrombolysis and the outcome data was generated by machine learning models predicting use of thrombolysis and outcome for that individual artificial patient. This data allows demonstration of the models, maintain many of the relationships between patient characteristics and use/outcome of thrombolysis, but should never be used for clinical research into stroke or for guidance on clinical decision-making.

\subsection{SAMueL-2 Web Application}

A web application has been made available to stroke teams at \url{https://stroke-predictions.streamlit.app/}. This web application allows teams to see descriptive statistics of all stroke teams, an analysis of the effect of potential pathway changes at each stroke team (using anonymised stroke team identity), and what thrombolysis decision each stroke team would make on a customisable patient (using anonymised stroke team identity). Figure \ref{fig:web_app} shows an example screenshot of potential thrombolysis use in one team, which could be potentially improved from 11.5\% to 20.3\%.

\textit{`Dear Martin (James). I just wanted to drop you a Thank You email for visiting our Trust today [to present the stroke audit machine learning and modelling work] with your colleagues; your presentation was superb, so inspirational in terms of the difference we can make for the patients who are not currently receiving thrombolysis; a great illustration of how we compare in our decision making to the ‘premier’ hospitals.....I think this is amazing work with huge clinical benefit. If it helps, I’d be very happy to provide a letter of support on behalf of the Trust/ISDN'.}

\subsection{Thrombolysis in Acute Stroke Collaborative (TASC)}

The SAMueL team has been providing bespoke reports to the \textit{Thrombolysis in Acute Stroke Collaborative} (TASC). TASC is an NHS-England sponsored and funded project working with NHS Elect. TASC is taking 6 low thrombolysing stroke teams and is helping them improve thrombolysis use. A follow up project, focusing on 12-15 more teams has been agreed.

SAMueL has highlighted how decision-making in thrombolysis is a significant source of variation in thrombolysis. This has been recognised by stroke teams in the TASC project, and teams are engaging with with this challenge, but teams are left to work on their own solutions. As an example, one team now meet monthly to review thrombolysis ‘grey’ cases and they have also embraced a buddy “phone a friend” culture whereby any of them can phone another colleague to discuss thrombolysis decisions in more borderline cases.

\section{Implications for decision makers}

\section{Research recommendations}

Recommendations for further research include:

\begin{itemize}

    \item How does variation in thrombolysis use (and resulting variation in outcomes) differ by population demographics?

    \item How does variation in thrombolysis use affect inpatient lengths of stay, and NHS bed use?

    \item How does use, benefit from, and bed use after, thrombectomy vary between admitting stroke team?

    \item Can causal inference methods (such as directed acyclic graphs, propensity score adjustment, and target trial emulation) confirm the conclusions made in this project?

    \item How do we maximise uptake and impact of this work?
    
\end{itemize}


\section{Conclusions}

We combined qualitative research and large-scale observational data with machine learning on use of, and outcomes from, thrombolysis. Both qualitative research and machine learning revealed significant between-hospital variation in which patients receive thrombolysis. Machine learning revealed that who will benefit from thrombolysis is patient-specific, and not easily captured in a simple medicine use label, but we found overall that stroke teams with a higher willingness to use thrombolysis are predicted to be generating better patient outcomes at a population level.
